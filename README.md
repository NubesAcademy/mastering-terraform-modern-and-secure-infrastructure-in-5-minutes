## Introduction

Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code (IaC) tool that allows you to define and provision infrastructure using a declarative configuration language. In this project, we will explore the power of Terraform by deploying a secure and modern infrastructure stack.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- Basic knowledge of cloud computing concepts.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project repository from [GitHub Link](https://github.com/oleksiy-pototskyy/mastering-terraform-modern-and-secure-infrastructure-in-5-minutes).

2. Subscribe on educational video course (https://www.udemy.com/course/mastering-terraform-modern-secure-infrastructure-in-5-min/?referralCode=73C9AB466B78FF8CF604)

3. Review the project structure to understand the layout and organization.

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

```

```

- `main.tf`: Terraform configuration file.
- `.github/workflows/`: Contains GitHub Actions configuration files.
- `scripts/`: Contains scripts used within the project.
- `README.md`: This document provides an overview of the project and its instructions.
- `LICENSE`: The project's license file.

## Step-by-Step Guide

Follow these steps to master Terraform and deploy a secure infrastructure:

### Step 1: Clone GitHub repository with the project 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NubesAcademy/mastering-terraform-modern-and-secure-infrastructure-in-5-minutes.git
```

### Step 1: Set Up Terraform

To begin, set up Terraform on your local machine by installing it and configuring the required providers.

### Step 2: Configure Providers

Configure the cloud providers (e.g., Hetzner, AWS, Azure) you'll be using in your Terraform configuration.

### Step 3: Define Resources

Define the infrastructure resources you want to create using Terraform's declarative configuration language.

### Step 4: Deploy Infrastructure

Deploy your infrastructure by running Terraform commands to create, update, or destroy resources.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've completed the project, and you can now confidently use Terraform to deploy modern and secure infrastructure on the cloud.
